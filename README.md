# Email-Sender
This Python code is a simple SMS simulation that allows the user to manage their inbox. The program is designed to create and manage emails. The user can add new emails, mark emails as read or spam, delete emails, and view their unread messages.

Getting Started
The program consists of a single Python script that can be run in any Python environment. To get started, simply copy the code into a new Python file or IDE and run the script.

Usage
The program provides a simple command-line interface that allows the user to manage their inbox. Upon running the script, the user will be prompted with a message asking them what they would like to do - read, mark spam, send, unread messages, delete, or quit.

Read
The "read" option allows the user to read an email by selecting its index number. If the email has already been deleted or does not exist, the program will print a message informing the user.

Mark Spam
The "mark spam" option allows the user to mark an email as spam. To do this, the user must enter the index number of the email they wish to mark as spam. The program will then mark the email as spam and print out the list of all spam emails.

Send
The "send" option allows the user to send a new email. The program will prompt the user to enter the email content and address, which will then be added to the inbox.

Unread Messages
The "unread messages" option allows the user to view all of their unread emails. If the user wants to view their unread emails, they can enter "yes" when prompted. The program will then display a list of all the unread emails.

Delete
The "delete" option allows the user to delete an email. To do this, the user must enter the index number of the email they wish to delete. The program will then remove the email from the inbox.

Quit
The "quit" option allows the user to exit the program.

Conclusion
This simple SMS simulation program allows the user to manage their inbox by adding, reading, marking as spam, deleting, and viewing their unread messages. It provides a basic command-line interface that is easy to use and can be run in any Python environment.
